# Weather-API

=> I developed a weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information.
=> The application allows users to switch between their current location's weather and search for weather in other cities.
=> Implemented features include geolocation retrieval, user-friendly UI updates, and asynchronous data fetching. Utilized modern web development practices for a responsive and interactive user experience.
